# A-Visual-History-of-Nobel-Prize-Winners
Project Description The Nobel Prize is perhaps the world's most well known scientific award. Every year it is given to scientists and scholars in chemistry, literature, physics, medicine, economics, and peace. The first Nobel Prize was handed out in 1901, and at that time the prize was Eurocentric and male-focused, but nowadays it's not biased in any way. Surely, right? This Project is an Exploratory Data Analysis of the Nobel Prize Winners from 1901-2016. The project involves data cleaning, feature creation, and visualization of trends. The dataset used in this project is from The Nobel Foundation on Kaggle and has been included.
